## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps:

Youtube mobile:
  * dark mode
  * shorts embedded in feed

Discord:
  * bottom nav bar
  * layout of channels

Instgram:
  * dark mode
  * explore page consists only of videos and posts

App idea:

  I'd like to build an app that allows users to create virtual photo albums. Users will be able to create a 
photo album with a title and a cover photo. Users can add a limited amount of photos to their albums. All albums 
appear on the home screen of the app. Clicking on an album opens it and users can turn the pages to see the photos 
they're added to it. Photo albums can be shared between users and acces social media platforms.

## Notes

It took a bit to get used to X-code. 

Dragging from UI elements to the text editor to create code was unfamiliar to me.
